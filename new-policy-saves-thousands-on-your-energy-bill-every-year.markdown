\#####How it Works
Solar panels are much cheaper today than they were 10 years ago. With high rebates and lower costs  homeowners are able to drastically reduce their power bill by **renting solar panels** from solar companies who have been able to do this thanks to solar incentive and state rebates. Instead of spending $10,000 upfront and waiting years to recover your investment you can start saving  instantly without having to  spend money upfront.
